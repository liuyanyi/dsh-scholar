# Deliberately NOT in SCRIPTS (documented so the list stays auditable):
#   * run-latex-tests.sh   — SKIPs (exit 0) when pdflatex is absent, so it is
#                            invoked by the dedicated CI "latex-compile" job
#                            (.github/workflows/ci.yml) after installing TeX,
#                            never by this aggregator (a SKIP here would fail
#                            CI=true fail-closed runs on TeX-less machines).
#   * run-standalone-http-tests.sh — nested INSIDE run-hardening-tests.sh
#                            (invoked at its tail; its non-zero exits and any
#                            SKIP text propagate through hardening into this
#                            aggregator's fail-closed checks).
#
# Usage: bash tests/security/run-all-v2-blocking-tests.sh
# The local CI gateway (scripts/ci-gate.sh, `pnpm test:ci`) runs this script
# with CI=true, so every SKIP/zero-assertion/unexecuted sub-script is
# fail-closed and the aggregator exit code contributes to the gate.
